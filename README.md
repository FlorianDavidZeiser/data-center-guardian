# Data Center Guardian – Defender of the Grid
![Cover](cover_game.png)

A small browser-based arcade-style experiment built together with AI tools as part of my ongoing exploration of generative AI, prototyping, and interactive media.

## How it works

Datacenter Guardian is a small resilience game.  
Fires break out in a data center. Alarms go off. Your job is to keep the systems alive for as long as possible.

You move, react and use different tools to:

- detect and contain fires  
- cool overheated racks  
- repair damaged infrastructure  
- keep the overall system from failing  

Survive as many waves as you can.  
Your score is stored locally so you can challenge yourself or others on the same machine.

## Features

- Browser-based game, no installation required  
- Wave-based difficulty curve  
- Score system and local leaderboard  
- Embedded original soundtrack (MP3)  
- Multiple tools for suppression, cooling and repair  
- Increasing pressure on attention and reaction over time  

## Built with AI

This project was created together with AI tools as a personal experiment.  
The focus was to explore how far someone who does not normally code games can go by iterating together with AI.

It follows earlier experiments with:

- AI generated images  
- a co-authored book with ChatGPT  
- short AI-assisted movie scenes  

Datacenter Guardian continues this line of experiments in the direction of interactive media.
